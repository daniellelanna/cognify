                A list of words will appear on the screen, and you should try to remember 
                <br> 
                as many as you can. Right after the words dissappear, you'll be asked to 
                <br>
                recall if each word shown was one of the original words. It's like a memory 
                <br>
                game, and it's important to tell a grown-up if you hit your head.
